Welcome to the password generation web app! This project was created as part of a coding challenge for the Scrimba Front End Career Path course.
This simple app allows you to generate a unique password with just a few clicks. Simply specify the desired password length, and whether or not 
you want to include special characters and numbers. Once you've made your selections, click the "Generate Password" button and a new password 
will be generated for you. You can easily copy the password to your clipboard by clicking on it after it has been generated.

This app is designed to help you create strong, secure passwords for all of your online accounts. Whether you're setting up a new account or 
just looking to update your current passwords, this app has got you covered. So give it a try, and start generating secure passwords today!
